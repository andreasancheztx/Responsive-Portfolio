        <p> I live in Corpus Christi, TX. Home of Selena, great Mexican food, and beautiful beaches.
          I was born and raised here. I went to Moody High School, and moved to San Antonio when I turned 18.
          I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I attained my BA in Communications. I spent 12 fun
          years in the Alamo City.
          I moved back to Corpus about four years ago to be closer to my family.
          <br>
          <br>
          I recently got married to a wonderful man whom I have known since I was about 14 years old.
          We have two dogs and a cat. We actually just found our second dog on a recent trip to San Antonio. In all
          honesty, we weren't wanting
          another pet, but she has made a home with us... and quite frankly, we are suckers.
          <br>
          <br>
          As far as my career goes, I have a very rewarding job working in Career Services. It has been a
          great experience working with the students. My newest venture for 2020 is to take this Web Development class
          so that I can learn Front End Development, and start a new career in something more challenging and hopefully
          fun (and MUCH
          higher
          paying!)

          <br>

          What can I say.. I am at an age and a point in my life where I want to do more, and have the ability to work
          in a field I have always been interested in. I am blessed with a great life, I am happy, and highly favored.
          This is an investment in
          myself, for my husband and our future children.
