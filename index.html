        <p> I live in Corpus Christi, TX. Home of Selena, great Mexican food, and beautiful beaches.
          I was born and raised here. I went to Moody High School, and moved to San Antonio when I turned 18.
          I attended UTSA, where I attained my BA in Communications. I spent 12 fun years in the Alamo City.
          I moved back to Corpus about 4 years ago to be closer to my family. I recently got married to a wonderful man
          I have known since I was about 14 years old.
          We have two dogs and a cat. We just found our 2nd dog in San Antonio. In all honesty, we weren't wanting
          another pet, but she has made a home with us... and quite
          frankly, we are suckers.
          <br>

          <br>
          As far as my career goes, I have a very boring job working in Career Services. All joking aside, it has been a
          great experience working with the students. I feel I have learned all I can learn in my current
          role, so I feel complacent. My newest venture for 2020 is to take this Web Development class so that I can
          learn
          Front End Development, and start a new career in something more challenging and hopefully fun (and MUCH higher
          paying!)
          My current company doesn't seem to like to give big raises.. and thats a problem for me and my pocket book.
          <br>

          <br>

          What can I say.. I am at an age and a point in my life where I want to do more, and have the ability to work
          in a field I have always
          been interested in. I am blessed with a great life, I am happy, and highly favored. This is an investment in
          myself, for my husband and our future children.
